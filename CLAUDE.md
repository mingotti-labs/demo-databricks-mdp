# CLAUDE.md — demo-databricks-mdp

Conventions for AI-assisted development on this Databricks Modern Data Platform.
This file captures platform-specific decisions; general coding standards are in the
global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.

## Platform context

- Databricks Free Edition (serverless compute only, single workspace)
- AWS-hosted workspace: https://dbc-e3197e2d-933b.cloud.databricks.com
- Unity Catalog: one metastore, environments separated by catalog

## Catalog & schema structure

Catalogs: `mdp_dev`, `mdp_tst`, `mdp_prd`

| Layer | Schema pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Bronze | `bronze_<source>` | Raw ingestion, append-only |
| Bronze history | `bronze_<source>_history` | Full change history, CDC replay safety net |
| Bronze publish | `bronze_<source>_publish` | Validated bronze, safe for downstream reads |
| Silver | `silver_<domain>` | Conformed, domain-modelled (domains TBD) |
| Gold | `gold_analytics_gateway` | BI / reporting consumers |
| Gold | `gold_integration_gateway` | Operational / API consumers |
| Gold | `gold_ai_gateway` | ML and GenAI consumers |

Always use 3-part names: `catalog.schema.table`. Never use bare or 2-part references.

## DAB targets

Three targets in `databricks.yml`, all pointing to the same workspace,
differentiated by catalog:

- `dev` → `mdp_dev`
- `tst` → `mdp_tst`
- `prd` → `mdp_prd`

## Sources

- **Neon Postgres** (serverless, free tier) — relational source
- **MongoDB Atlas** (M0 free cluster) — document source

## Development style

- Notebook-first: logic lives in Databricks notebooks (stored as `.py` source files
  in the bundle). Shared utilities go in `src/` as importable Python modules.
- Formatter: `ruff` for all Python (notebooks and scripts).
- Package manager: `uv` (see global CLAUDE.md).

## Guardrails — never do without explicit confirmation

- No classic clusters — serverless only
- No account-level API calls (Free Edition scope is workspace-level only)
- No `%run` — use proper imports from `src/`
- No `%pip install` in notebooks — declare dependencies in bundle config
- No hardcoded secrets or connection strings — always `dbutils.secrets.get()`
- No destructive DDL (`DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE`) without explicit user approval
- No direct writes to `mdp_prd` catalog from ad-hoc notebooks
